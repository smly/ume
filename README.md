Ume
===

My private framework/toolbox for a data mining task.

This application's main goal is to provide a framework that is able to increase
reproducibility and productivity for a data mining competition on kaggle.com.

Bootstrapping
-------------

Ume requires very strict dependencies, so setting up a new virtual environment for Ume is recommended:

```
$ pwd
/home/smly/workspace/ume
$ ./bootstrap
(snip)
$ source venv/bin/active
$ which python
/home/smly/workspace/ume/venv/bin/python
$ which pip
/home/smly/workspace/ume/venv/bin/pip
$ pip install https://github.com/smly/ume/archive/v2.0.zip
$ source venv/bin/active
$ which ume
/home/smly/workspace/ume/venv/bin/ume
```

Documentation
-------------

I have no plan to describe how to use this product in details.
If you are interested in it, plase send me pull request :-)
